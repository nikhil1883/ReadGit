Hi, I’m [Your Name]. I have 2.5 years of experience working as an AWS Developer. My work mainly focuses on building and deploying cloud-native applications on AWS.

I’ve designed serverless architectures using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and S3. I’m also experienced in using AWS CDK and CloudFormation for infrastructure as code. I’ve implemented CI/CD pipelines with CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and Git integration to automate deployments.

In my last project, I worked on migrating a monolithic app to a serverless architecture, improving performance and reducing operational costs. I also follow AWS security best practices like IAM role management, encryption, and monitoring with CloudWatch.

I’m passionate about AWS technologies and always eager to learn and apply new services or patterns to solve business problems effectively.
